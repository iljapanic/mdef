WHO IS MY AUDIENCE?

Victor and Mr. Teacher



WHAT IS MY OBJECTIVE?

To convince them that we should know how things work



WHAT IS THE ONE MOST IMPORTANT TAKEAWAY?

Convince them than the open-source making movement has the potential to spark a maker in all of us









*sketching in hardware*

objects as interfaces

incredible complexity embedded inside common everyday objects

intelligence/sensing embedded in a material (coffee maker - metal piece that is calibrated to change shape at a certain temperature and acts as a switch)

<quote author="Nikola Tesla (1926)" reference="14">“When wireless is perfectly applied the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain, which in fact it is, all things being particles of a real and rhythmic whole. We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance. Not only this, but through television and telephony we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of miles; and the instruments through which we shall be able to do his will be amazingly simple compared with our present telephone. A man will be able to carry one in his vest pocket.”
