In a series of intense workshops we developed and produced a series consisting of 5 episodes inspired by the TV series Black Mirror. But rather than the dystopian overtone, we followed the ethos of _critically optimistic design fiction_. We have done a stand-up check-in at the beginning of every workshop and finished with a check out â€“ sharing how we feel and what our expectations are. This simple excercise proved to be surpsingly valuable in formulating our thoughts.
