This week was an intense crash course in the core concepts in the fields of artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and subjects relating to extending human intelligence. I have been exploring these themes for several years now, so the course was right down my alley. This has allowed me to explore more speculative and provocative ideas in some of our group discussions.  Besides some experiments with [Faceswap](https://github.com/deepfakes/faceswap), I have been mostly focused on the ethical and sociocultural aspects of AI. Therefore I found the technical primer into the underlying mechanisms of machine learning particularly valuable.

Throughout the course, [Ramon Sangüesa](https://twitter.com/ramonsang) provided firm philosophical grounding and plenty of food for thought, while [Lucas Peña](http://lucaslorenzopena.com/) delivered a barrage of in-depth technical concepts and provocations that made us second-guess our initial assumptions. They both worked exceptionally well together and complimented each other to present a comprehensive and engaging overview of the field.

What follows is a sort of a free-form essay related to particular aspects of AI/extended intelligence that I find most salient, intriguing and relevant to my future research.



## Conscious intelligence?

Right at the outset of the week, we got into a lively debate about what constitutes intelligence and how do we decide which organisms (or objects) are intelligent. We have come up with various descriptions and partial-definitions, but eventually, we have ended up with a conception so broad and vague that we needed to consider virtually everything around us at intelligent to a higher or lesser degree.

Our conclusions are in line with a techno-optimist strain of Kurzwelian thought that believes that AI will cure all of our ills and that we will ultimately merge with the machines in the grand moment of the singularity. This idea is stemming from a mechanistic view of intelligence as a form of computation based on informational inputs and outputs where the ‘computation is substrate-independent in the same way that information is: it can take on a life of its own, independent of its physical substrate’ [^1].

Thus if intelligence is embedded at a molecular level as a material called [computronium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computronium) - a form of programmable matter – then there is no question whether it is possible to create an inorganic AI that is as (or more) intelligent than humans. It is just a matter of generating a sufficient computational power. Neural networks are directly based on the metaphor of the human brain and simulating connections between neurons.

With that being said, **intelligence does not equal consciousness** and this is where our scientific theory falls utterly short to the point of sheer ignorance. Men-made AI is improving at an exponential rate but we are nowhere near any sort of artifitical consciousness. This presents a major challenge because the most thorny questions facing humanity and its relationship to technology and the spaceship Earth are ethical, moral and cultural – all products of our imagination and consciousnes without any basis in the physical reality.

Unleashing super intelligent entities out in the world without a proper understanding of consciousness is 









## A false promise of AI?

## Misguided fears

Despite the hype, the threat posed by AI is significant 

Fears of AI promoted by popular fiction are deeply misguided.

AI doesn’t present threat in itself but it set to exguberate existing problems.

Whatsmore, 

as Harrari argues, AI does not need to be super-intelligent nor even human-level intelligenent to take over the world. It just needs to be good enought to outperform us at specific tasks. It is already swaying democratic elections and controlling the financial markets.

“...the real risk with AGI isn’t malice but competence” [^3] as illustrated with a [paperclip maximizer thought experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence#Paperclip_maximizer) attributed to Nick Bostron. In this fictional scenario an owner of a paperclip factory orders an AI to optimise a production of paperclips with no additional instructions. The seemingly benign task leads the AI to destroy earth in order to obtain more material so it can conquer other galaxies, eventually consuming the entire spacetime in the pursuit of more paperclips. A [Frank Lantz](http://www.franklantz.net/) from NYU has created a game inspired by this concept – [Universal Paperclips](http://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html) – while it is only text-based it is surpsingly entertaning (and informative). Be warned, once you start playing it you will not let go until you finish it in a few hours time.




### Reality blending

Synthetic media feeding on human’s pechant for visual imaginary

“with enough data, everything becomes texture”

DARPA is already has programs for analysing “threat that synthetic media poses to national security”



“synthesis of events that didn’t happen”

“Historically, it will turn out that there was this weird time when people just assumed that photography and videography were *true*. And now that very short little period is fading. Maybe it should’ve faded a long time ago.”

“In the emerging world of “synthetic media,” the work of digital-image creation—once the domain of highly skilled programmers and Hollywood special-effects artists—could be automated by expert systems capable of producing realism on a vast scale.” - https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/11/12/in-the-age-of-ai-is-seeing-still-believing

“For example, once AI becomes able to generate fully realistic fake videos of you committing crimes, will you vote for a system where the government tracks everyone’s whereabouts at all times and can provide you with an ironclad alibi if needed?”



Ultimately space exploration will be done via AI not our feeble human capsules

## Promise







Entire existence and perception of reality as a controlled hallucination







The more we explore 



With that being said, I did not have a feeling that anyone in the group actually shared these reductionist views





Through a more esoteric lense every living being and even inorganic matger has some sort of ephermal cosmic consciousness
