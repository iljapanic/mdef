I decided to do an absolute bare minimum of research before starting the experiment.

## What is resin?

## Resin picking

I collected the first batch of resin in one afternoon hike to the Green Fab Lab in Valdaura and back. At the beginning I had hard time finding the right trees and spotting resin on them. But with each examined tree I was getting better at tacitly recognizing which ones have a higher chance of having resin leaking from them and to discern at distance resin covered in dirt from bark of the tree.

Curiously enough, it wasn't the largest holes and scars that accumulated the most resin in them. It was often rather small openings or seemingly undamaged surfaces that were my most potent source. It is worth noting, that the process of collecting was quite tedious, as you have to repeatedly scrape the tree and fiddle your knife in small gaps to obtain what amounts to resin dust in the end. On a few lucky occasions I was able to pick larger solid chunks.

It was particularly interesting to see the different properties of the material depending on the age and tree it was picked from. Fresh resin had a clear color and was too sticky and runny to be picked at all, while older resin was significantly darker, dry, solid and covered in debris, making it difficult to spot, but quite easy to pick. It also seemed that different trees produce differently colored resin. Since I only noticed this after the fact, I was not able to observe which tree produces certain types of resin.

On a more personal note, going out in the woods to collect resin turned out to be a deeply enjoyable and meditative experience. As I was getting more immersed in the whole process I started talking to the trees – apologizing for poking them with my tiny knife, thanking them for their resin, commenting on the surroundings and sometimes just talking about whatever crossed my mind at that moment. At first, I was taken aback by my actions but I quickly accepted it as part of the learning. This behavior that would likely be considered out of the social norm in an urban context felt completely natural, acceptable and even encouraged in the forest context. Despite being the only specimen of homo sapiens in the vicinity, I did not feel alone.

As the day progressed I felt my senses heighten and get more attuned to the subtle rhythms of the Valdaura forest which resulted in my increased ability to spot and collect resin. Insights gained from this experience were a great example of the value of embodied learning as well as being highly relevant to my final project which focuses on non-human intelligence and improving our connection to other living organisms.



##Resin cooking



Each time I have gone through a cycle of heating up the resin and then waiting for it to cool down its properties changed slightly – color was turning darker, the mix was becoming more liquid and the solidified substance seemed overall less sticky and more brittle.

## The resin futures

Due to time constraints and limited availability of hand-picked resin I was not able to push the limits of my chosen material. In the process of experimenting and presenting the initial outcomes I have gained new knowledge that will affect my future work with this material. First, I would like to try [a better method for purifying the resin and filtering out the debris](link:://///). Secondly,

I would love to incorporate resin as one of the materials in my final project due to its function as a protective agent for trees.
