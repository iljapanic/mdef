This week we worked on conveying our ideas for final projects in an engaging and relatable manner. The sessions with Heather from Kickstarter in particular have stressed the importance of translating ellusive and abstract conpcets into tangible and concrete actions or artefacts in order to appeal to wider audiences.





## Engaging species







numerous environmental, cultural and political challenges



need to reevaluate our relationship with technology, nature and each other





According to Jung we have lostt emotional participation with nature which has resulted in a ‘sense of cosmic and social isolation’ [^1]



The current environmental challenges, the largest existential threat in the history of humanity, can be directly linked to our disfunctional relationship with the natural world around us.



reevaluate human-to-planet relationship

move away from human-centered design towards a holistic multi-species approach 









> *“The planet is dying because we are satisfied with our limited relationships in which control, denial, and abuse are tolerated. The status quo is that we have these petty relationships with each other, between nations, with ourselves and the natural world. Why should we bother? Because healthy relationships are not an esoteric goal. It is a matter of our very survival and the survival of most of the life upon this earth.”*

To change our relationship we need to stop thinking of planet Earth throught purely materialistic and mechanistic lense. 



The Gaian view of earth a large self-organising organism has been dismissed as pseudo science since at the time it was proposed by James E. Lovelock’s in the 1970’s. [^3] However, new scientific findings increasingly give empirical validity to an idea intuitively held by many  that the planet Earth and virtually everything on it is sentient.





> *“The Gaia theory has found such powerful purchase in the human world because it reminds us of something many of us intuitively know to be true (and which every four-year-old child understands): that the world is alive, intelligent, aware, communicative, and filled with soul; that we are not alone; that we are part of something much larger than ourselves; that we are companioned by millions upon millions of related life-forms; and that the dead, mechanical world we have been taught about in school does not exist . . . and never has. It restores a crucial dimension to human life, and human habitation of this planet.”*

But how do we restore that lost connection to the ever-present invisible planetary meta-consicoussnes?

I would argue that fungi may contain some of the answers.





## Fungal link

mushroom, fungi, mycelim - may turn out to be the key for improving and perserving planetary health



“The twenty-first century may be remembered as the Biotech Age, when these kinds of mycotechnologies play a prominent and increasing role in strengthening habitat health”



animals are more closely related to fungi than to any other kingdom (Stamets)



mycelium a link between those worlds





Paul Stamets - mycelium as Earth’s natural Internet







a symbiotic merger of humans, fungi and AI into a supra-terrestrial hyper-conscious meta-organism

through

AI-mediated human-mycelium interface for spiritual awakening and perpetual food production



*“I see the mycelium as the Earth’s natural Internet, a consciousness with which we might be able to communicate. Through cross-species interfacing, we may one day exchange information with these sentient cellular networks. Because these externalized neurological nets sense any impression upon them, from footsteps to falling tree branches, they could relay enormous amounts of data regarding the movements of all organisms through the landscape.”*

— Paul Stamets, Mycelium Running (2005)

## Takeaways



The course has brought home the importance of distilling complex and abstract issues in a relatable and simple manner in order to engage varying audiences with ever-shorter attention spans.
