# Design for the New

This essay analyses and comments on Transition Design (TD) approach as proposed by Irwin Terry in her 2018 conference paper entitled *The Emerging Transition Design Approach*. The paper presents an approach that seeks to address the so-called ‘wicked’ problems – such as climate change, inequality, pollution, loss of biodiversity, etc.- in an attempt to ‘seed and catalyse societal transitions toward more sustainable and desirable long-term futures.‘ (Terry, 2018, p. 1) 

The author argues that fields such as service design, experience design, meta-design or sustainable design have broaden the scope of traditional design to take a more systemic view when addressing complex problems. However, they ‘still tend to frame problems within relatively narrow spatio-temporal contexts and do not offer a comprehensive approach for identifying all stakeholders and addressing their conflicts.’ (Terry, 2018, p. 2)

Terry proposes a *Transition Design Framework* (TDF) which, rather then being a static linear process, strives to synthesise different set of evolving practices for change at the system level. Compared to contemporary design practice, it frames problems within radically large spatio-temporal contexts and tries to gain a deeper socio-technical understanding of all the stakeholders, as well as addressing their conflicts, which many design approaches tend to overlook.

Transition Design Framework can be used to:
 1. visualize and “map” complex problems and their interconnections and interdependencies;
2. situate them within large, spatio-temporal contexts;
3. identify and bridge stakeholder conflicts and leverage alignments;
4. facilitate stakeholders in the co-creation of visions of desirable futures;
5. identify leverage points in the large problem system in which to situate design interventions.


The TDF can be applied within three phases:

1. Re-framing present and future
2. Designing interventions
3. Waiting and observing

The phases are mutually reinforcing and can be re-iterated as new knowledge is gained. They are also broad enough to accommodate a variety of practices and processes.

The following sections take a closer look at my proposed intervention through the lens of the Transition Design Phases.


## Cyberbiomatic futures

I have framed my intervention as a platform for promoting biosemiotic literacy and dissemination of reference materials, resources and projects that are paving the way towards regenerative futures in full symbiosis with the planet Earth – an inter-species school of thought for the 21st century.

The main goal of the project is to foster a perception of non-human living organisms not just as sentient beings but as part a broader field of cosmic proto-consciousness. To that end, I have aimed to develop well-rounded and inspirational artefacts that strive to induce a sense of wonder and curiosity towards natural and more-than-human entities.


### 1. Reframing the present and future

This phase starts with mapping stakeholder concerns, but given the immensely broad theoretical scope of my project it is difficult to pin point particular stakeholders — at least within the human realm. In a sense the primary stakeholder is the Mother Earth herself alongside all other living organisms living on it and within there is a sub-stakeholder in the form of homo sapiens.

The main concern of Earth is to recalibrate planetary dynamics and restore the balance disrupted by human activities. This is in direct conflict with concerns of humanity, which strives to raise and keep its standard of living that is, in its current state, wasteful, unsustainable and destructive.

To envision a more desirable and optimistic future I use the perspective of *Ecocene* which strives towards regenerative design economies centred around ‘ecologically literate perspectives that foreground nature’s regenerative capacities.’ (Boehnert, 2019, p. 3) Rather than extraction and exploitation, it is a philosophy based on a relation of reciprocity and mutual symbiosis. It is a design that ‘mimics the processes of nature to increase diversity, modularity, tightness of feedbacks, increasing redundancy, mutually supportive networks, self-regulation based on information and resource exchange within nested networks, the sharing of abundance.’ (Boehnert, 2019, p. 9)

On a more personal level, we need to revivify the ancient appreciation for the wonders of nature and become more attentive to the perceptual and biosemiotics dimension of the life on planet Earth — we are long overdue for a new environmental ethic as eloquently described by Abram (1997, p. 69):

>*It may be that the new “environmental ethic” toward which so many environmental philosophers aspire—an ethic that would lead us to respect and heed not only the lives of our fellow humans but also the life and well-being of the rest of nature—will come into existence not primarily through the logical elucidation of new philosophical principles and legislative strictures, but through a renewed attentiveness to this perceptual dimension that underlies all our logics, through a rejuvenation of our carnal, sensorial empathy with the living land that sustains us.*

On a more pragmatic note, the up-and-coming philosophical genre of *solarpunk* offers a tangible vision of desirable futures. Solarpunk has ‘the artistic and literary power to push beyond our cultural doomsday mindspeak and make us believe in the future again.’ (Valentine, 2015). What makes the idea of solarpunk so potent is that it works from our existing technologies based on things we already know are possible. Solarpunk futures envision a world of distributed clean energy, available and benefiting everyone in a society that functions more like an ecology — non-hierarchical, cooperative, diverse, and seeking balance. (Owens, 2016) Its imagery is one of Art Nouveau aesthetics with lush green urban areas fully immersed in symbiotic relationship with the surrounding landscape and the planet as a whole.


### 2. Design interventions

The project consists of two main design actions. First involves designing and building a space for biosemiotic contemplation in a form on an immersive installation accompanied by a selection of floating posters with obscure terms and their definitions. The focal point of the exhibit is an organically shaped platform filled with soil and two plants. Using projection mapping, the installation alters the perception of plant communication by visualising a faux-mycelial network in which particles are floating between the two plants, simulating an information exchange. Once a participant approaches the platform and puts their hands on top of the soil particles start floating between them and the plants; making the participant feel like they have become a part of the mycelial network. The overarching aim of the installation is to generate a sense of intrigue and wonder in participants — enough for them to take their phones out and investigate the presented concepts and ideas further.

The second action consists of designing and developing an online platform for curating and synthesising resources and references from a variety of fields loosely related to biosemiotics. The intention is to regularly update the site, as well as generate outreach through social media channels. The site aims to be an authoritative repository of biosemiotic fields of inquiry, innovations and artefacts — presenting visitors with a plethora of tools and methods for imagining positive futures in a symbiotic relationship with planet Earth. The website is available at [cyberbiomes.org](https://cyberbiomes.org).

### 3. Waiting and observing

Because complex systems are self-organizing and self-determined, it is not possible to predict how will they respond to perturbations. The context for the intervention — set in social organisations and socio-technical systems — will ‘rarely respond to an intervention the way we think it will.’ (Terry, 2018, p. 16)

TDF is in direct opposition to our obsession for fast-paced innovation and efficiency. It suggests a form of slow knowledge generation which Terry (2018) compares to Chinese acupuncture in which ‘an acupuncturist will closely observe the patient for a period of time in order to understand the imbalances or blocks in the system (body) and then place needles along specific meridians in order to shift energy.’ (p. 16).

The breakthroughs in synthetic biology, shifting collective attitudes towards impending climate catastrophe, renewed interest in indigenous ontologies and renaissance of research into psychedelics are some of the contemporary perturbations that are slowly but surely playing out and are worth observing in the foreseeable future.

## Concluding thoughts

It was quite challenging to fit my intervention within boundaries of the TDF, or any framework for that matter. Cyberbiomes as an idea is inherently multidisciplinary and hovers between broader areas of technology, science and spirituality. The spiritual aspect of the intervention makes it particularly difficult to define or somehow formalise the field of social practice.

Rather than transitional design, what I'm proposing is *transcendental design* – a practice that transcends all the historical practices and unifies them through a synergetic merger of nature, indigenous ways of knowing and techno-scientific methods.
