Biosemiotics is the study of signs, of communication, and of information exchange in terrestrial living organisms that goes beyond the constraints of spoken and written language. From the perspective of ecocritical biosemiotics language is about ‘how beings bring forth their lifeworlds […] in dynamic conjunction with the lifeworlds of other entities.’ (Gagliano, Ryan, & Vieira, 2017, p. xix)

Other related terms include ethnobotany, plant cognition, biocybernetics, biomimetics, or bioacoustics – just a fraction of a long list of loosely-related areas of studies investigating how the non-human organisms communicate among themselves and with each other.

In this essay, the biosemiotics are viewed in a broad sense as an ‘interchange of two languages: the biosemiotics of vegetal life and human signification.’ (Marder, 2017, p. 109). The synthesis presented here illustrates new epistemological approaches and ways of knowing that acknowledge the value of plural ontologies (Boehnert, 2019).

The dominant language systems have grammatically and syntactically deprived other-than-human beings of their animacy. Jung (2002) refers to these linguistic and perceptual limitations as the tyranny of words. We need to learn to navigate the bilingual world between the lexicon of science and what Kimmerer (2017) refers to as the grammar of animacy. Kimmerer (2017, p. 131) gives a poetic example from the language of Potawatomi, a Native American people from the Great Lakes region:

> When bay is a noun, it is defined by humans, trapped between its shores and contained by the word. But the verb wiikegama—to be a bay—releases the water from bondage and lets it live. “To be a bay” holds the wonder that, for this moment, the living water has decided to shelter itself between these shores, conversing with cedar roots and a flock of baby mergansers. Because it could do otherwise—become a stream or an ocean or a waterfall, and there are verbs for that, too.

A closer look at indigenous cultures and their ancestral ontologies embedded within the natural landscape provides a potent lens for analysing how we might bridge this biosemiotic gap.

## Indigenous meets scientific

We have been conditioned to dismiss ancestral and indigenous ways of knowing as ‘primitive’ and based on imagination, rather than hard scientific truths. But we fail to realise that the modern civilisation is entirely based on myths and stories that we have constructed to make the organisation of large-scale populations easier, effective and arguably more oppressive.

In his first book Sapiens, a recently popularised historian Harari (2015) aptly describes this collective cognitive dissonance:

> People easily understand that ‘primitives’ cement their social order by believing in ghosts and spirits, and gathering each full moon to dance together around the campfire. What we fail to appreciate is that our modern institutions function on exactly the same basis. Take for example the world of business corporations. Modern businesspeople and lawyers are, in fact, powerful sorcerers. The principal difference between them and tribal shamans is that modern lawyers tell far stranger tales.

A renowned 20th century cultural theorist Joseph Campbell, most known for his work in comparative mythology, argues that ‘our story of the Fall in the Garden sees nature as corrupt; and that myth corrupts the whole world for us’ which in his view results in ‘a totally different civilization and totally different way of living according to whether your myth presents nature as fallen or whether nature is in itself a manifestation of divinity.’ (Campbell & Moyers, 1991, p. 121)

This disconnect from nature is visible in our spiritually deprived Western culture that privileges objectified information and pays little to no attention to spiritual and emotional dimensions of life on Earth. We have much to learn from the indigenous ways of being in which boundaries between animals and the animate landscape are absent.

Robin Wall Kimmerer has written extensively about integrating our scientific ecological knowledge (SEK) with that of traditional ecological knowledge (TEK), which ‘refers to the knowledge, practices, and beliefs about the relationship of living beings to one another and to the physical environment that are held by peoples in relatively nontechnological societies with a direct dependence on local resources’. (Kimmerer, 2011, p. 265)

TEK has been marginalised by the scientific community despite the fact that the United Nations Environment Programme (1998) has recognised it as having equal status with scientific knowledge. (Kimmerer, 2011) But recent cultural trends and an opening up of new frontiers of scientific inquiry suggest that we are slowly recognising perceptual limitations of our dominant ontological structures.

> Modern scientific knowledge, with its accompanying world view of humans as being apart from and above the natural world has been extraordinarily successful in furthering human understanding and manipulation of simpler systems. However, neither this world view nor scientific knowledge have been particularly successful when confronted with complex ecological systems. These complex systems vary greatly on spatial and temporal scales rendering the generalizations that positivistic science has come up with of little value in furnishing practical prescriptions for sustainable resource use […]. Science-based societies have tended to overuse and simplify such complex ecological systems, resulting in a whole series of problems of resource exhaustion and environmental degradation.

## Exploring the limits of consciousness

When it comes to a spiritual connection to nature and planet Earth, the psychedelics are the obvious elephant in the room. Unfortunately, the term carries significant conceptual and semantic baggage carried over from the rise of the counterculture in the 1960s and subsequent reactionary handling of the situation that has all but shut down any serious inquiry into the potential of these compounds for purposes of Gaian healing and uncovering the secrets of consciousness.

Our current civilisation associates altered states of consciousness induced by psychedelics primarily with entertainment and hedonistic pursuits. However, humans have been using naturally occurring psycho-active plants and compounds for most of the history of our species in a ritual and highly spiritual context. There is actually not a culture on earth ‘that doesn’t make use of certain plants to change the contents of the mind, whether as a matter of healing, habit, or spiritual practice.’ (Pollan, 2018, p. 13).

Archaeological evidence shows us that virtually all the previous civilisations had a mystical relationship with psychoactive plants to a greater or lesser extent, including the Dionysian mysteries in ancient Greece and Rome. It was with the phasing out of pagan traditions and the rise of organised, mostly monotheistic, religions that use of mind-altering plants has increasingly become taboo in the wider society.

There is little doubt that use of these chemicals to alter the states of perception have significantly contributed to early humans’ keen interest in nature of being and fostered a deeper spiritual connection to the local flora and fauna. Which brings us to the ‘the epitome of all mycocentric speculation’ – the ‘stoned ape’ hypothesis from a cultural theorist and late 20th-century psychedelics evangelist Terence McKenna (Pollan, 2018, p. 115).

McKenna (1996, p. 24) went as far as to suggest that the rapid acceleration in the development of human consciousness and symbolic language was caused by the increased sensory acuity and a sense of wonder induced by ingesting plants containing psychoactive compounds:

> My contention is that mutation-causing, psychoactive chemical compounds in the early human diet directly influenced the rapid reorganization of the brain’s information-processing capacities. Alkaloids in plants […] could be the chemical factors in the protohuman diet that catalyzed the emergence of human self-reflection. The action of hallucinogens present in many common plants enhanced our information-processing activity, or environmental sensitivity, and thus contributed to the sudden expansion of the human brain size. At a later stage in this same process, hallucinogens acted as catalysts in the development of imagination, fueling the creation of internal stratagems and hopes that may well have synergized the emergence of language and religion.

Because consumption of psilocybin mushrooms by early hominids would not leave any fossil record, McKenna’s hypothesis is not really susceptible to proof or disproof (Pollan, 2018, p. 116). More than a theory of biological evolution, it is a theory of cultural evolution based on a relatively commonsensical assumption that our ancestors have likely experimented and co-evolved with psychoactive plants that grow widely across the entire planet and that have been living on the face of the Earth long before our species even appeared on the scene.

The Western ontological dogma associates consciousness primarily with humans and in rare cases with certain animal classes. From this perspective, the locus of thought and imagination originates in the brain organ. However, there is a growing number of theories, that fall under the philosophical view of panpsychism, suggesting an existence of a proto-consciousness as a ubiquitous property of the universe. The socio-cultural theories of distributed consciousness are gradually being corroborated with findings from quantum-relativistic physics which increasingly lend support to formerly esoteric ideas such as the existence of infinite timeliness and parallel universes.

The resurgence of medical research into psychedelics, recent efforts to decriminalise naturally occurring psychedelic substances in the US (Voytko, 2019) as well as growing cultural acceptance suggest that we starting to explore ‘other modes consciousness that might offer us specific benefits, whether therapeutic, spiritual, or creative.’ (Pollan, 2018, p. 16)
A radically biosemiotic perspective suggests that the primordial vegetal and mycelial organisms contain ancient knowledge that can be accessed through different means, psychedelics being only one of them. Other ancient forms of inducing non-ordinary states of consciousness include meditation, yoga, systemic breath work, rhythmic dance, music, or fasting. Shamans and seers have historically functioned as cultural architects whose role was to be the bonding medium between human and more-than-human worlds.

Traditionally shaman ’acts as an intermediary between the human community and the larger ecological field, ensuring that there is an appropriate flow of nourishment, not just from the landscape to the human inhabitants, but from the human community back to the local earth.’ (Abram, 1997, p. 7)

In our contemporary culture, shamans have been replaced with a techno-utopian breed of mostly Silicon Valley technologist born out of the psychedelics-infused era of early stages of personal computing. (Rushkoff, 2002) This generation of IT visionaries embodied the hacker ethos and shared a vision of open Internet controlled by the people using it. However, after the Dot-com bubble burst at the turn of the millennium, the idealism and utopian inclinations have been replaced with a ruthless economic drive for optimisation and creation of an unprecedented surveillance assemblage fuelled by venture capital and corporate interests.

Silicon Valley has retained its positive attitude towards mind-altering substances, however, the psychedelics are increasingly seen as productivity enhancers and mood boosters, particularly in the form of so-called micro-dosing. It is debatable whether such narrowly focused use diminishes spiritual and biosemiotics potential of these substances, nevertheless it is important to explore the trends and attitudes towards altered states of consciousness in Silicon Valley. After all, they are the people who are designing and building our modern day immersive devices that serve as prosthetics that allow us to transcend time and space – in some sense, it can be argued that our current technology is the most potent psychedelic humanity has ever encountered.

Can we bridge the gap and merge these technologically induced psychedelic states with the ancient lifeworld originating from nature?

## From Anthropocene to Ecocene

Earliest mentions of Anthropocene date to mid-1970s (Steffen, Grinevald, Crutzen, & McNeill, 2011), but it is only since about the time of Paris Agreement in 2016 that the term has gained a more official standing in the public and scientific discourse. In a purely rational sense, the term is an apt designation for our geographical epoch in which human species and their activity are the main driving forces shaping the face of planet Earth today.

However, as a narrative tool, the term Anthropocene conveys elusive doomsdays overtones that evoke the feeling of a self-fulfilling prophecy and inevitability of the collapse of our civilisation through the obliteration of our home planet. We need a different, more constructive and pro-active framing, one that imagines and works towards preferable futures. Boehnert (2019) suggests we instead conceptualise our epoch through a lens of Ecocene that ‘challenges anthropocentric modes of domination that arise from reductive and extractive ontologies.’ (Boehnert, 2019, p. 3).

Ecocene strives towards regenerative design economies centred around ‘ecologically literate perspectives that foreground nature’s regenerative capacities.’ (Boehnert, 2019, p. 3) Rather than extraction and exploitation, it is a philosophy based on a relation of reciprocity and mutual symbiosis. It is a design that ‘mimics the processes of nature to increase diversity, modularity, tightness of feedbacks, increasing redundancy, mutually supportive networks, self-regulation based on information and resource exchange within nested networks, the sharing of abundance.’ (Boehnert, 2019, p. 9)

On a more personal level, we need to revivify the ancient appreciation for the wonders of nature and become more attentive to the perceptual and biosemiotics dimension of the life on planet Earth — we are long overdue for a new environmental ethic as eloquently described by Abram (1997, p. 69):

> It may be that the new “environmental ethic” toward which so many environmental philosophers aspire—an ethic that would lead us to respect and heed not only the lives of our fellow humans but also the life and well-being of the rest of nature—will come into existence not primarily through the logical elucidation of new philosophical principles and legislative strictures, but through a renewed attentiveness to this perceptual dimension that underlies all our logics, through a rejuvenation of our carnal, sensorial empathy with the living land that sustains us.
