### Pau Alsina

### Indy Johar

I was a bit disappointed that Indy didn't make the planned appearance in the course. I had an honour to see Indy speak in-person on two occasions - first on a conference in Copenhagen and then on an academic gathering in London. Indy has a sober and pragmatic approach to urban innovation which he presents with an impactful rhetoric that actually has a power to change people’s minds. I hope that we get to talk with him later during the master's programme. Meanwhile, here is a video of his talk from the [Made in Space](https://www.madeinspace.io/) conference organised by Space10.

### Tomás Díez

Tomás has a natural ability to convey complex ideas in an understandable and relatable manner. I especially enjoy his willingness   to openly talk about the paradoxes, contradictions and sometimes outright hypocrisies of living as an informed/concerned citizen in a modern urban setting. Tomás’s also has an aptitude to portray rather disturbing realities in somehow positive light which is a skill that I hope to acquire over time.


## Going down the crypto hole

There is no way we could discuss emerging and disruptive technologies without eventually getting into an endless discussion about blockchain and cryptocurrencies. I see some promise in the concept of a distributed ledger. [Estonia is a good example](https://medium.com/e-residency-blog/welcome-to-the-blockchain-nation-5d9b46c06fd4) of a national organisation which has adopted the technology in a meaningful manner long before all the media hype. [^1] I do have my doubts about the promise of cryptocurrencies, particularly as long as they are embedded in an existing economic system based on fiat money and speculation.

One of the biggest proclaimed advantages of blockchain is its inherent transparency. It is therefore peculiar that it is one of the emerging technologies that is most difficult to grasp conceptually. Sure, blockchain holds great promise for humanity, but as long as we collectively understand it. Otherwise, it might lead to even higher concentration of resources and power by a tiny technocratic elite. Here I share concerns expressed eloquently by one of my favourite urbanists [Adam Greenfield](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18299688.Adam_Greenfield) who argues that blockchain is ‘just fundamentally difficult for otherwise intelligent and highly capable people to understand’ [^2].

Rather than getting bogged down with details, I will leave you with 3 videos that touch upon the multi-faceted aspects of blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
