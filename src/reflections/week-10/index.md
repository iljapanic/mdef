# An Introduction to the Future

## Day 1 - Foundations of Futures Thinking

- 'unthink the future'
- we have downloaded Black Mirror-esque visions of future as a piece of software in our collective way of thinking
- lack of plans and common visions
- mental structures
- beyond dystopia/utopia dichotomies -> *protopias*





## Day 2

### archaeology of futures

- history of futures
- importance of images of futures
- MAYA - mostly advanced yet accepted
- pre-modern and non-western ancient futures
- the future, as we understand it, is a modern concept





## Day 3



extended present - the oldest way to engage with futures with a scientific approach



we don’t make or trust predictions

forecasting, not predictions

futures becomes plural as a consequence of forecast



importance of finding out what we do **not** know 



a **trend** is a measurement of change over time

- needs to be qunatifiable
- there needs to be a time frequency, ideally as regular as possible
