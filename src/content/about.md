My name is Ilja, Iâ€™m a designer and technologist from Prague currently based in Barcelona.

I research a wide range of themes related to emerging technologies, ubiquitous computing, information design, human-computer interaction, computational ethics, and information behaviour.

I love coffee, books and vinyl.
