## Introduction to the problem

We have lost the primordial connection to our planet. We are bringing ourselves along with countless other species on a brink of extinction. We are in an abusive relationship with the mother Earth which is increasingly showing signs that it will not tolerate our destructive behaviour for much longer.

The unceasing barrage of scientific discoveries and technology have monopolised our perceptual field, making us blind to the ebbs and flows of the natural world that sustain us. To restore the lost connection we need to completely re-conceptualise how we collectively relate and interact with our planet and the species we share it with.

Therefore, I have framed my project as a platform for promoting biosemiotic literacy and dissemination of reference materials, resources and projects that are paving the way towards regenerative futures in full symbiosis with the planet Earth – an inter-species school of thought for the 21st century.


## What I'm going to do?

The main goal of the project here is to foster a perception of non-human living organisms not just as sentient beings but as part a broader field of cosmic proto-consciousness. To that end, I aim to develop well-rounded and inspirational artefacts that strive to induce a sense of wonder and curiosity towards natural and more-than-human entities. The project will consist of two artefacts.

First will involve designing and building a space for biosemiotic contemplation in a form on an immersive installation accompanied by a selection of floating posters with obscure terms and their definitions. The focal point of the exhibit will be an organically shaped platform filled with soil and two plants. Using projection mapping, the installation alters the perception of plant communication by visualising a faux-mycelial network in which particles are floating between the two plants, simulating an information exchange. Once a participant approaches the platform and puts their hands on top of the soil particles start floating between them and the plants; making the participant feel like they have become a part of the mycelial network. The overarching aim of the installation is to generate a sense of intrigue and wonder in participants – enough for them to take their phones out and investigate the presented concepts and ideas further.
  
The second artefact consists of designing and developing an online platform for curating and synthesising resources and references from a variety of fields loosely related to biosemiotics. The intention is to regularly update the site, as well as generate outreach through social media channels. The site aims to be an authoritative repository of biosemiotic fields of inquiry, innovations and artefacts – presenting visitors with a plethora of tools and methods for imagining positive futures in a symbiotic relationship with planet Earth. The website is available at [cyberbiomes.org](https://cyberbiomes.org).


## Bill of materials (BOM)

Interactive installation:

- 1x plywood sheet 18x2400x1250mm (for CNC)
- 2x pots for plants
- 2x plants
- 1x projector
- 1x projector mount
- 1x copper tabe stripe 100x100m
- 1x ESP8266 controller
- 1x 1M ohm resistor
- 1x crocodile clip
- 1x wooden log, approx. 1000mm in height
- 2x 40L bags of soil

Tools and services used to develop the installation and the website:

- [Netlify](http://netlify.com)
- GitLab
- [Zapier](https://zapier.com)
- VS Code
- Arduino IDE
- Hyper terminal

## What has been done before?

There are many examples listed under the project section of the project homepage at [cyberbiomes.org](https://cyberbiomes.org/).

## What is the schedule? Real VS Ideal

Ideal — getting everything up and running by June 14th.

Real — getting everything up and running the day before the opening of the exhibition on the June 25th. 

## How will it be evaluated?

Mostly by how people respond to the installation as well as how many people visit the website, how much time they spend on it researching the materials as well as how many people follow the social media account of the project. Eventually, I hope that other people will show interest in contributing and reaching out to feature relevant projects.
